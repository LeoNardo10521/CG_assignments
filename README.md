### (1) The environment: openGL3.7 & visual studio 2017 community
### (2) Language: c++
### (3) Run the program:
#### a) Begin a visual studio 2017 project and contain the “ques1.cpp”/“ques1_version2.cpp”

#### c) You can see a red cube with shade in the middle of the window just as “screeshot1_1.png”/ “screeshot1_2.png” shows.
### (4) Notes:
#### a) I realize the 3d view of the red cube in two ways: one use “gluLookAt” function and one use “glRotatef” function so I hand in two versions. In fact the output of the programs are just the same.
#### b) For more details about the program please refer to the comments in the “ques1.cpp”/“ques1_version2.cpp”.
